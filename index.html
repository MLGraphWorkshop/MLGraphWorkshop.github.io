    <h2>Overview and Objective</h2>
    <p>
        Graph, as a unified data structure representing pairwise relationships between entities, exists universally in different domains, 
        including computer science, social science, physics, chemistry, biology, infrastructure, finance, psychology, etc. 
        Due to its broad applicability, many real-world applications could be formulated as graph-based tasks. 
        For example, friend recommendation in social networks can be regarded as a link prediction task, 
        categorizing academic paper topics can be treated as a node classification task, 
        designing molecules following certain properties can be deemed as a graph generation task, 
        and optimizing sensor localization can be formulated as an influence-maximization-based decision-making task. 
        Through years of research, graph machine learning has gradually formed a well-established ecosystem capable of automating these tasks and driving real-world applications. 
        With the increasing maturity of GML, the recent emergence of large foundational models, such as large language models and multi-modal systems, 
        has propelled machine learning into a new AGI era and revolutionized the research landscape of many fields. 
        However, the well-established GML is still predominately anchored in pre-AGI paradigms, creating a significant gap in understanding how it should evolve to fully leverage the opportunities, 
        address the challenges, and comprehensively embrace this transformative AGI era. 
        This motivates us to host this workshop to gather academic and industrial researchers/practitioners to present and share the development of GML in the AGI paradigm 
        and envision how GML communities could embrace this new AGI era.

    <h2>Submission Details</h2>
    <p>
        We welcome submissions of papers ranging from 4 to 8 pages as main content, with up to 2 additional pages containing references and an optional appendix.
        All submissions must be in PDF format and formatted according to the new ACM format published in <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM guidelines</a> (e.g., using the ACM LaTeX template on Overleaf <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/acm-official#.WOuOk2e1taQ">here</a>)
        and selecting the “sigconf” sample. Following the WWW’24 conference submission policy, reviews are double-blind, and author names and affiliations should NOT be listed. 
        Submitted works will be assessed based on their novelty, technical quality, potential impact, and clarity of writing (and should be in English). 
        For papers that primarily rely on empirical evaluations, the experimental settings and results should be clearly presented and repeatable. 
        We encourage authors to make data and code available publicly when possible.
        <br>
        Accepted papers will be posted on this workshop website. By default, accepted papers will not appear in the KDD’25 proceedings and are thus non-archival. 
        This allows authors to submit works that are concurrently under review elsewhere or published.
        <br>
        The best paper (according to the reviewers’ ratings and organizing committee) will be announced at the end of the workshop.
        <br>
        At least one of the authors of the accepted workshop papers must register for the workshop and be present on the day of the workshop.
        <br>
        For questions regarding submissions, please contact us at: yuwang@uoregon.edu
